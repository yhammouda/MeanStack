See the overall picture of **implementations a mean stack applications** on real-world project;

![MEAN stack Architecture](https://github.com/yhammouda/MeanStack/blob/main/mean-stack-flow.png)

The MEAN stack is a full-stack, JavaScript-based framework for developing web applications. MEAN stands for MongoDB Express Angular Node, after the four key technologies that make up the different layers of the stack.
