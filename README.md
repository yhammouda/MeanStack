## Whats Including In This Repository
We have implemented below **MEAN stack application that create missions and transactions with CRUD functions**.


See the overall picture of **implementations a mean stack applications** on real-world project;

![MEAN stack Architecture](https://github.com/yhammouda/MeanStack/blob/main/mean-stack-flow.png)

The MEAN stack is a full-stack, JavaScript-based framework for developing web applications. MEAN stands for MongoDB Express Angular Node, after the four key technologies that make up the different layers of the stack. 

## Run The Project
You will need the following tools:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download/)
* [Node js 10.19.0 or later](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* [Angular CLI 11.0.6](https://cli.angular.io/)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Installing
Follow these steps to get your development environment set up: (Before Run Start the Docker Desktop)
1. Clone the repository
2. At the root directory which include **docker-compose.yml** files, run below command to create a mongo DB instance :
```csharp
sudo docker-compose up -d
```
3. Wait for docker compose all. Thatâ€™s it!

4. At the Mean-App directory which include **package.json** file, run below command to download the dependency(node modules) / run the backend application on port 3000 /run the angular app on port 4200 / :
* **npm install -> install all dependencies**
* **npm run start:server -> http://localhost:3000/**
* **ng serve -> http://localhost:4200/**

5. You can **launch the application** as below url:
* **Backend Application -> http://localhost:3000/**
* **Web UI -> http://localhost:4200/**

6. Launch http://localhost:4200/ in your browser to view the Web UI.

## The Book - Microservices Architecture and Step by Step Implementation on .NET

You can find **Microservices Architecture and Step by Step Implementation on .NET book** which **step by step developing** this repository with extensive explanations and details. This book is the **best path to leverage your .NET skills** in every aspect from beginner to senior level you can benefit to ramp-up faster on **Enterprise Application Development practices** and easy to **Onboarding to Full Stack .Net Core Developer jobs**. 

The book also includes more practical information and I **update it regularly** and send it again with new versions.
So the idea is once you buy a book, I take this as **supporting me** and **join them in my privilege group** for sharing **next outputs**.
For example I am planning to add **IdentityServer4 implementation**, firstly I added it into a book and sent it to you.

# What is AspnetRun ? 
The best path to **leverage your ASP.NET Core** skills. Onboarding to **Full Stack .Net Core Developer** jobs. Boilerplate for **ASP.NET Core reference application** with **Entity Framework Core**, demonstrating a layered application architecture with DDD best practices. Implements NLayer **Hexagonal architecture** (Core, Application, Infrastructure and Presentation Layers) and **Domain Driven Design** (Entities, Repositories, Domain/Application Services, DTO's...) 
and aimed to be a **Clean Architecture**, with applying **SOLID principles** in order to use for a project template. 
Also implements **best practices** like **loosely-coupled, dependency-inverted** architecture and using **design patterns** such as **Dependency Injection**, logging, validation, exception handling, localization and so on.

You can check full repository documentations and step by step development of **[100+ page e-book PDF](https://aspnetrun.azurewebsites.net)** from here - **https://aspnetrun.azurewebsites.net**. Also detail introduction of book and project structure exists on **[medium aspnetrun page](https://medium.com/aspnetrun)**. You can follow **aspnetrun repositories** for building **step by step** asp.net core **web development skills**.
